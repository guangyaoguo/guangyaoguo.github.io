I am currently a Master student(Online) in computer science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, specifically focusing on computer science and machine learning, before UIUC, I had the privilege of conducting research in deep learning applications for genomics under the guidance of <a href='https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/v1/?page=profile&id=ericluzhang'>Prof. ZHANG, Eric Lu</a> at Hong Kong Baptist University. This research experience not only deepened my understanding of machine learning but also allowed me to explore its interdisciplinary applications.  Prior to joining HKBU, I got a Bachelor's degree in Advanced Computing with First Class Honours from the University of Sydney. 

It's been a wonderful experience delving into theoretical computer science during my honours year, fourturnately guided by dedicated advisor [Dr. Andr√© van Renssen](https://andrevanrenssen.droppages.com/) at Sydney Algorithms and Computing Theory Group ([SACT](https://sydneyalgorithms.wordpress.com/)), where I completed my [honours thesis](assets/pdf/Online_Routing_on_Delaunay_Triangulations_in_the_Presence_of_Obstacles.pdf) with High Distinction, focusing on computational geometry.
